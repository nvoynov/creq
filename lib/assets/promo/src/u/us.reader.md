# [.reader] Reader
{{parent: us}}

A requirements reader uses requirements in his day to day work as an input for other project activities, or participates in requirements review process.

##

As a reader, I want each requirement to have the unique identifier, so that I can refer to it in other project artifacts.

##

As a reader, I want to comment or request a requirements clarification, so that I help to eliminate all the requirement ambiguities.

##

As a reader, I want to get requirements in a particular document format (PDF, Html, MS Word, OpenDocument, etc.), so that I can use my usual tools to work with the document.
