[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/creq.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/creq) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nvoynov/creq.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nvoynov/creq) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/nvoynov/creq/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/nvoynov/creq)

The CReq is a simple and customizable tool for requirements management. It provides ability of writing requirements in isolated markdown files and combining those files into a single and consistent requirements specification document.

The CReq is simple enough in itself, but when you combine it with Ruby, a modern text editor and Git, this combination will bring you unprecedented power and flexibility in requirements management.

## Purpose

Develop a simple and efficient approach for requirements management practice (gathering and writing; prioritizing and efforts estimation; tracing to other project artifacts) through exploring:
* a sufficient and custom format to describe requirement by analysts and consume those by project members team (unique requirement identification; requirement attributes suitable to certain project);
* a consistent requirements repository format that will be easy understandable for both human and machine;
* a minimum set of required tools with the possibility of rapid adoption to a certain project needs, that are free and ready to use.

## Installation

Install the minireq gem:

    $ gem install creq

Of course you can choose the other standard way through cloning repository and installing the gem by hand (you must also have [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) installed):

    $ git clone https://github.com/nvoynov/creq.git
    $ cd creq    
    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rake install

## Promo

CReq is supplied by Creq Promo Project. This project contains software requirements for Creq.

You can copy Creq Promo Project content into the current directory by `creq promo` command. When promo project is copied, you can simply create Creq Requirements Document by `creq doc` command.

## Usage

### Requirements file format

Requirements file is a usual Markdown file with a few additional compliances. Let's look at the next two example files `content.md` and `feature1.md`.

**content.md**
```markdown
# [f] Functional requirements
{{
suppress_id: true
child_order: feature1 feature2  
}}
# [i] Interfaces
# [n] Non-functional requirements
# [c] Design constraints
```

**feature1.md**
```markdown
# [f1] Feature 1
{{
parent: f
status: proposed
source: nvoynov  
}}
The System shall provide the Feature 1.

## [f1.data] Data
The System shall provide the next data for `Feature 1`

## [f1.cmd1] Command 1
The System shall provide `Command 1`. When `Command 1` is received, the System shall do something.

## [f2.cmd2] Command 2
The System shall provide `Command 2`. When `Command 2` is received, the System shall do something other than `Command 1` (see [[f2.cmd1]] for details).
```

Every requirement starts with markdown header. All the text between headers is a requirement body. The body can contain an excerpt with requirement attributes.

#### Attributes

The excerpt, the text in brackets `{{ }}`, contains attributes. You can place here anything you need, like requirement status, source, risk, priority, etc.

The next three attributes are **system attributes** and they influence to Creq behavior. So that:
* `suppress_id: true` will suppress requirement [id] in header of the target document;
* `child_order: feature1 feature2` will sort child requirements in provided order;
* `parent: f` will place `[f1]` requirements subtree as a child requirement into `[f]` requirement.

All other attributes (`status`, `source`) are **user attributes** and do not influence to Creq behavior. These attributes are just held in requirements attributes hash.

#### Requirements tree

The Creq will parse two files displayed above and build the next requirements tree:

```
[f] Functional requirements
    [f1] Feature 1
         [f1.data] Data
         [f1.cmd1] Command 1
         [f1.cmd2] Command 2
[i] Interfaces
[n] Non-functional requirements
[c] Design constraints
```

#### Check errors

Creq can check requirements repository for duplicate requirement ids and wrong links. To demonstrate these features, run the next commands (I hope you already have `content.md` and `feature.md` files) and see the output.

    $ cp reqs/feature1.md reqs/feature2.md
    $ creq chk

#### Create requirements document

Fix the errors by providing unique ids in `reqs/feature.2md`, then run `minireq doc`...

### CLI

Creq provide five essential commands:
* new - create new creq project in the current directory;
* promo - copy promo project content to the current creq project directory;
* req - create a new requirement file;
* chk - check requirement repository consistence;
* doc - combine all requirements into single document.

You can see all available commands through `minireq help` command, and you can get help by certain command by `minireq help <command>` command.

To start using Minireq just create a new project:

    $ creq new myproject
    $ cd myproject

Try creq commands on Promo project:

    $ minireq promo
    $ minireq req
    $ minireq chk
    $ minireq doc

#### Extend it yourself!

You can and should extend standard CLI interface by your own commands. Just see example `<project>.thor` file in the created project and add the necessary tasks. It is all Ruby code.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
